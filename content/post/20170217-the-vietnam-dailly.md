Markets were mixed with strong gains by banks and real estate & construction. EIB, STB, ROS and CTD all made a positive contribution to the index while VNM, CTG, VCB and GAS all had negative contribution to the index. Though foreigners were active buyers and sellers on VNM today, they ended the day as net sellers.
