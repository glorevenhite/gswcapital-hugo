The market saw some nice gains today to go along with a few losses for selected bluechips. Market breadth was quite narrow and we saw 28 stocks hit the ceiling while 20 stocks fell to the floor. Foreigners were somewhat less active today with much more selling than buying.

Markets were mixed with strong gains by banks and real estate & construction. EIB, STB, ROS and CTD all made a positive contribution to the index while VNM, CTG, VCB and GAS all had negative contribution to the index. Though foreigners were active buyers and sellers on VNM today, they ended the day as net sellers.
